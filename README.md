## Programming Puzzles - Mike Ion

This is my landing page for some Programming Puzzles I have solved over the past few years in my free time to improve my coding skills/learn algorithms.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles completed daily by programmers around the world 
during the month of December. Here, I submit my solutions to the exercises, written in `Python 3.7` using jupyter notebooks in [deepnote](http://deepnote.com).
